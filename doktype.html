        <h2> The Magic of Glowing Creatures </h2>
        <p> Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It
            happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light.
            It’s like nature’s version of neon lights! </p>
        <p> Here’s how it works: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen. </li>
            <li> An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process. </li>
            <li> Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.” </li>
        </ol>
